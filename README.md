# notesApp

In order to run this app you will need a simple web server running to serve the files.  
I like the one below.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server

If using terminal, run the web server in the same directory as index.html by typing ws, 
and you should be able to view the app at localhost:8000.

This was built to be a mobile app.  It is styled for that purpose only.  
It will look too spacey on a desktop sized browser.
